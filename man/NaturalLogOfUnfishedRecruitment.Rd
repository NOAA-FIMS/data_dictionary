\item{Examples}{}
\item{Rationale}{The notation for this value is vast, which can be seen
in the number of alternatives. It is most important to remember that the
units of the measure of unfished recruitment before the natural log is taken
is in 1000â€™s of recruits or fish. Both ln and log are used even though the
transformation is for sure not a base-10 transformation and is rather a
transformation on the natural-log scale.}
\item{Synonym or Similar Terms}{logR0, \code{logR_0}, log(R0), R0}
\item{Range of possible values}{0--Inf}
\item{Units}{ln(numbers x 1000)}
