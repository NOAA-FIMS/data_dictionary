8,Totbio,Total biomass (males +females),double,ton,NA,Total stock biomass in weight
9,Totcatch,Total catch (m+f) in weight,double,ton,NA,Total catch (all the dead fish)
10,season,season,integer,NA,NA,The season
11,lnr0,natural log of unfished recruitment,double,numbers in thousands,NA,The average number of fish recruited to the population under equilibrium conditions on the natural-log scale.
12,agecomp,age composition,double,NA,NA,"A matrix of proportions of observed ages per age categories that are typically summarized by time period, data source, and sex."
13,CPUE,fish caught in one unit of effort,double,NA,NA,The quantity of fish caught (in numbers or weight)
14,FMSY,fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield,double,NA,NA,The fishing mortality rate that achieves the maximum sustainable yield
15,Forecast,a probabilistic statement about future events,NA,NA,NA,a probabilistic statement about future events
16,Cohort,Individuals of a stock born in the same spawning season.,NA,NA,NA,Individuals of a stock born in the same spawning season.
