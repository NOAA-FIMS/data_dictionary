Fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield (FMSY): A biological reference point for fisheries management based on the fishing mortality rate (F) that achieves the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). 
Examples:
Rationale: The notation used for reference points of commonly calculated values is inconsistent. For example, some use subscripts where the subscript can be in either all capital letters or all lower-case letters, some use lower-case letters for the type of reference point, and some use all capital letters.
Alternatives: Fproxy, F_msy, Fmsy
Range of possible values: 0--Inf
Units: $time^{-1}$
