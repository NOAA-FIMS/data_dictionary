Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE): A time-series vector corresponding to the amount of catch per standard unit of fishing effort, e.g., 1000 hooks per day or per hour of trawling, as a measure of relative abundance. Data can be geo-referenced although they do not need to be. CPUE indices are typically associated with an estimate of their selectivity and catchability.
Examples: fishery-independent CPUE
Rationale: Many models use the term index for a survey and CPUE for fishery-dependent data but they are typically entered into an input file in the same way and the naming should be standardized to a single overarching term. The overarching term would facilitate the inclusion of environmental data thought to index at least a portion of the population dynamics as well as fishery data. Environmental data does not necessarily have a catch or unit of effort associated with it, and thus, the term CPUE does not apply. Often CPUE data are thought to be a relative index of abundance and would never be considered absolute such as can be the case for an acoustic survey that does not kill the population but rather creates a metric of its abundance potentially over the entire area in which it is thought to inhabit. Where, an absolute index of abundance would be assumed to have a catchability of one.
Alternatives: catch rate, index of abundance, standardized fishery catch time series
