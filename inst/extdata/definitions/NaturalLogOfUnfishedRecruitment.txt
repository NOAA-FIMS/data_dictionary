Natural log of unfished recruitment (lnR0): The average number of fish recruited to the population under equilibrium conditions on the natural-log scale.
Examples:
Rationale: The notation for this value is vast, which can be seen in the number of alternatives. It is most important to remember that the units of the measure of unfished recruitment before the natural log is taken is in 1000â€™s of recruits or fish. Both ln and log are used even though the transformation is for sure not a base-10 transformation and is rather a transformation on the natural-log scale.
Alternatives: logR0, logR_0, log(R0), R0
Range of possible values: 0--Inf
Units: ln(numbers x 1000)
