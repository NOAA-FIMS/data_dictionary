Instantaneous fishing mortality rate (F): Instantaneous exponential rate at which fish are being removed from the population due to fishing. Many other platforms distinguish between different F. For example, looking at ASAP, we have Average F (across a certain age range), Total F (by age), N-weighted, B-weighted. ICES calls Average F Fbar. I think these both (SAM definitely does) incorporate selectivity. Apical F - at the peak of selectivity curve?
Examples: Fun (ICES) is fishing mortality of unwanted catch
Rationale: It is often not clear whether fishing mortality refers to the instantaneous rate or finite rate, where the latter would apply to a fixed time period. Some suggest using upper case for instantaneous rates and lower case for finite rates. For example an F of 0.5 would correspond to 40% of the population being removed or a finite rate of 0.4. Furthermore, F can sometimes pertain to just a range of the age structure and may or may not account for selectivity.
Alternatives: harvest rate, exploitation rate, finite fishing mortality, apical F
Range of possible values: 0--Inf
Units: $time^{-1}$
