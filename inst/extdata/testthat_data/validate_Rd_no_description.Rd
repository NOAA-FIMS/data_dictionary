\item{Examples}{spawning biomass, age three-plus biomass, exploitable
biomass, January 1 biomass}
\item{Rationale}{Measurements of biomass should be better defined making
it clear what year classes and sexes it includes. Historically, verbose
labels, e.g., January 1 biomass of age-three plus fish in 2022, are not
typically used; instead, labels are short, e.g., 2022 3+ biomass.
Additional ambiguity can come from the lack of knowledge regarding the
unit of measurement, which should always be metric tons. Some alternatives
are not interchangeable because they are in different units, e.g.,
abundance, which is in terms of numbers rather than weight.}
\item{Alternatives}{stock biomass, total biomass, abundance (numbers of fish),
biomass wet weight, biomass index}
\item{Range of possible values}{0--Inf}
