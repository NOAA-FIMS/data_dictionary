#' Spawning Biomass (SB)
#'
#' 1. The total weight of all fish (both males and females)
#' in the population that contribute to reproduction. Often
#' conventionally defined as the biomass of all individuals
#' beyond “age at first maturity” or “size at first maturity,”
#' i.e. beyond the age or size class in which 50 percent of
#' the individuals are mature; 2. The total biomass of fish
#' of reproductive age during the breeding season of a
#' stock. Most often used as a proxy for measuring
#' egg production, the SSB depends on the abundance of
#' the various age classes composing the stock and their
#' past exploitation pattern, rate of growth, fishing and
#' natural mortality rates, onset of sexual maturity, and
#' environmental conditions.

#' \item{Rationale}{Spawning biomass and spawning stock biomass have
#' both been used historically, though the former is shorter without
#' sacrificing clarity. For single-sex models, spawning biomass often
#' pertains only to females but text should be specific, e.g., female
#' spawning biomass. The alternative, spawning output, is only viable
#' for species that exhibit multiple spawning events per fish within a
#' time period and have pelagic eggs.}
