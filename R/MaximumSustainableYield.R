#' Maximum Sustainable Yield
#' 
#' A maximum level of yield that can be continuously taken from an exploited 
#' stock under average environmental conditions. It can be defined given 
#' biological parameters (e.g., natural mortality and stock productivity) or 
#' using proxies (e.g., the maximum yield at 40% of unfished biomass). Units 
#' depend on units of catches.
