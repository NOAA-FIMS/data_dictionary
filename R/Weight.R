#' \item{Rationale}{The unit of measurement for the weight of individual
#' fish can vary by country or even between sampling organizations. For
#' example, some organizations measure fish weight in pounds rather than
#' in kilograms and sometimes kilograms are reported using grams. The metric
#' system is an internationally agreed-upon system of measurement and, more
#' specifically, the International System of Units (SI) is used in science
#' and should be used for fisheries science. Thus, measurements of mass
#' should be reported in kilograms (kg).}
