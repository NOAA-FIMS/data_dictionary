#' \item{Rationale}{The notation for this value is vast, which can be seen
#' in the number of alternatives. It is most important to remember that the
#' units of the measure of unfished recruitment before the natural log is taken
#' is in 1000â€™s of recruits or fish. Both ln and log are used even though the
#' transformation is for sure not a base-10 transformation and is rather a
#' transformation on the natural-log scale.}
