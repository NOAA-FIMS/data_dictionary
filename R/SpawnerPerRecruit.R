#' Spawner per recruit (SPR)
#'
#' The ratio of the amount of spawning biomass produced by a cohort over its
#' lifespan under a specific fishing regime relative to the spawning biomass
#' produced over the cohort's lifespan under no fishing. The numerator will
#' always be smaller than the denominator because of mortality from fishing.
#' Only information about the life history and fishing is needed for the
#' calculation, whereas other reference points may need information about
#' recruitment, making it a common proxy for reference points based on maximum
#' sustainable yield.
