#' Recruits
#' 
#' The number of fish transitioning to a different life stage 
#' (Lorenzen and Camp, 2019), typically from that of a pre-juvenile stage 
#' that could experience density-dependent life-history processes to a 
#' juvenile stage without density-dependent processes.
#' 
#' @format An item of type schema with the following fields:

#' \item{Rationale}{Recruitment can also be used to describe fish reaching a 
#' legal size and becoming vulnerable to harvesting, though we will label it 
#' as such rather than recruitment to the stock. Age-0 fish are typically 
#' referred to as recruits but documentation should state the age at which 
#' fish are recruited because there is no standard.}
