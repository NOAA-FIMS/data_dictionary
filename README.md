# data_dictionary
A flexible data dictionary for fisheries

We follow the template described [here](https://data.nal.usda.gov/data-dictionary-blank-template), such that column headers are:


Explanation of column headers:
- Spreadsheet tab: If your spreadsheet has multiple tabs, identify the tab you are describing.
- Element or value display name​: What is the name used in your data file?
- Description​: Write a brief definition, stated in the singular, that could stand alone from other element definitions.
- Data type​: For example, indicate varchar, integer, date, etc.
- Character length​: For example, the maximum length for Excel is 255, so indicate 255 or less.
- Acceptable values​: List all acceptable values, separated by pipes ( | ). This may be a field name or a range of values.
- Required?​: Enter y/n to indicate whether this field is required.
- Accepts null value?​: This required to run calculations on your data. Indicate y/n if null value is allowable.
(A note on null values: Null is the absence of a recorded value for a field. A null value differs from a value of zero in that zero may represent the measure of an attribute, while a null value indicates that no measurement has been taken.)
